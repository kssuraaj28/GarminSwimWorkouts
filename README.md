# Directions
`run.sh` # Runs everything

You should have a sample fit file

# Adding workouts to Garmin Device

# Adding workouts to Garmin Device calender
 * Connect to your computer using USB.
 * Upload .fit files to `Garmin/Workouts/Schedule`.
 * The name of the workout file matters here! For example: `2024-09-24.fit   2024-09-24_1.fit` indicates two workouts scheduled on 24th of September 2024.

# TODOs
 * Clean the project
 * Maybe separate workouts better
 * We are using bad bad bad java hacks to make this work
 * It seems to me that the watch does deduplication
 * It is possible for workouts to have "general notes" (If you use connect to create workouts). I need to figure out how to do this
